# README File Generator<br>

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)<br>

## Description:<br>

A CLI application to generate a clean, detailed README.md file from user date input for a series of question prompts. The application uses JavaScript, Node.JS, Axios, and Inquirer packages to facilitate the generation of the file. Inquirer prompts are uses to display the questions to the user and collect the input data. Axios was used to request user information from the GitHub API. Node.JS is the framework within which the application runs.<br>

The purpose of the application is to present the user with a simple interface to input their project information based on prompts and then have a README file generated with all of their project's copy formatted nicely for the README file to include in their project repository.<br>

## Installation:<br>

My files can be accessed in the repository [HERE](https://github.com/arcangyl1963/README-File-Generator)
The image below shows the repository where my project files are located:

![README File Generator Repository](./assets/images/readme_file_generator_repo.png)

Install the application by cloning the repo from the link above or by downloading the files to your local drive.

The repository will contain all of the files needed to run the application:

* A 'utils' directory containing the module scripts for the API requests and the generation of the markdown text.
* A package.json file that contains the dependencies required for the application to run.
* An index.js script file that is the core of the application which the user invokes to run the application.

First begin by installing any dependencies required to run the application and to setup the development environment on your local repository.<br>

In Terminal or a similar bash command-line utility, navigate to the working directory and enter:<br>

~~~
npm install
~~~

This will install any packages dependencies defined in the package.json file.
Now that the required packages have been installed, the application can be launched.

---

## Usage:<br>
To launch the application type the following into Terminal or the command-line utility of your choice:

~~~
node index.js
~~~

The first question prompt will appear if the launch is successful. Read each question carefully and enter you answers for each prompt.

The next prompt will display after you enter a reponse to the previous question.

When the README file has been successfully created, a prompt appears noting the success.
